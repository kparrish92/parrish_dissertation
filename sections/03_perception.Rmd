# Introduction 

The body of research on phonetic and phonological learning has uncovered a crucial role for the proximity of the native language of a given speaker and the language they are learning.
For example, the empirical basis for two major models of L2 phonology, the Speech Learning Model and the Perceptual Assimilation Model, posit key roles for the native phonological structure of a speaker when predicting the ease or difficulty of acquiring specific L2 sounds. 
For example, it has been shown that speakers of languages with a long-short lag VOT distinction in stop consonants have difficulty acquiring native-like VOT values in their L2 if it is a true voicing language [@reeder1998english; @nagle2019longitudinal].
Additionally, it is difficult for speakers to perceive differences in two distinct L2 categories that would both be good exemplars on a native category, such as Spanish speakers who have difficulty acquiring the /i/-/\textsci/ contrast [@flege1997effects]. 
Both of these difficulties arise, presumably, due to the native phonology of the learner.

These models do not address whether, in addition to one's native phonological structure, additional (L2) categories can also impact the subsequent learning of sounds.
In other words, it is not clear whether both the native and L2 phonological systems may both be possible sources of influence during new language learning. 
The present chapter tested whether both the L1 and L2 of a speaker are used in the very initial stage of learning a new, third language. 
In the first experiment, German and French vowels were categorized given both English and Spanish categories. 
The perceptual assimilation task was designed to determine whether bilingual speakers would categorize new language sounds using both English and Spanish, or whether would be biased to one language or the other. 
In experiment 2, the discrimination of English vowel contrasts in L3 words were tested.
This experiment avoids categorization and measures discrimination of sounds with the aim of showing whether phonetic discrimination is possible in a new language when the sound contrast exists in either the L1 or the L2.
If speakers categorized and discriminated new language sounds using both Spanish and English phonology, this would suggest that it is not simply native language phonology that predicts new language learning, but that all previously known languages may play a role in the learning of a new language sound system.

## Perception/perceptual assimilation in L2 and L3 speech 

Previous research has found that the ease of learning sounds in a new language depends upon your language background and experience [@escudero_effect_2014; @escudero_cross-language_2011; @escudero_spanish_2010; @bohn_nonnative_2007]. 
In particular, it has been found that the phonemic and phonetic qualities of ones native language can predict the ease or difficulty of sound contrast perception in both accented L1 and L2 speech. 
For example, when they were asked to categorize vowel sounds of  Standard Southern British English (SSBE), speakers of Salento Italian categorized three SSBE vowel sounds as their native /a/ (/\ae/, /\textscripta/ and /\textturnv/), and also did not discriminate these three sounds efficiently [@escudero_effect_2014].
This finding suggests that experience with Italian, a five vowel system with a quantity distinction, makes the discrimination of languages with larger vowel inventories more difficult than it would be for a speaker of a language with a similarly large vowel system. 
Other language pairings also show evidence for this phenomenon, such as Spanish listeners categorized Dutch /a/ and /a:/ as their Spanish /a/ [@escudero_cross-language_2011], and Spanish speakers categorizing Canadian English /\ae/ and /\textepsilon/ to Spanish /a/ [@escudero_cross-language_2011], where speakers of languages with a smaller vowel inventory would categorize more than one vowel sound in another language as one in their native language. 
In other cases, speakers have matched two novel-language vowels to two of their native categories. 
@escudero_spanish_2010 found that Spanish speakers assimilated English vowel sounds to their Spanish /a/ and /e/, although they assimilated British /\ae/ to their Spanish /a/ and English /\ae/ to their Spanish /e/, while matching /a/ in both dialects to their Spanish /a/.
Taken together, these studies suggest that native language categories impact the categorization of sounds in a new language, although they did not explicitly investigate whether second language sounds may have a similar effect. 

Best and Tyler formalized the idea that the ease of the perception of any new language is driven by the phonemic and phonetic differences between the inventories of the speaker's native language and an unknown language. 
Originally proposed to account for non-native (foreign accented) speech perception, the Perceptual Assimilation Model (*PAM*; @bohn_nonnative_2007) has also been extended to L2 learning (PAM-L2). 
The model predicts that when languages (the one known and the one being learned) are more similar in terms of how sounds contrast, then they will be easier to effectively perceive.
For instance, in what the PAM calls Two-Category Assimilation, two L1 categories would be hypothetically matched to two L2 categories, and discrimination of that L2 contrast would be predicted to be very good.
On the other hand, in the event that one L1 category corresponds to two L2 categories, discrimination is predicted to be poor (Single-category Assimilation). 

Despite the general empirical support for the model, the PAM has not explicitly discussed whether bilingual language learners approach learning new-language sounds differently than monolinguals.
In their 2007 chapter, Best and Tyler state that "the relative ease or difficulty of a given contrast varies according to the listener's native language" (p. 16), but make no mention of bilingual listeners.
It is not clear whether, if given the option, speakers could be guided by both their native and subsequently learned languages when asked to categorize new language sounds.
Very little research exists testing whether this is the case. 
@wrembel_extending_2019 examined the categorization of L3 German vowels by 10 multilingual L1 Polish, L2 English, L3 German speakers, given L1 and L2 categories from which they could choose. 
They found that the speakers assimilated L3 sounds to both their L1 and L2, with a preference for L2 sounds, suggesting that subsequently learned languages might guide subsequent language perception in addition to the native language. 
@onishi_effects_2016 examined the impact of L2 experience on L3 contrast perception ability in speakers of L1 Korean, L2 English and L3 Japanese and found that better experience with specific L2 contrasts correlated to better perception of those same contrasts in the L3 contrasts, but only in some cases.
These studies provide evidence that speakers may draw upon more than simply their native language when accounting for new language sounds. 
However, since the @@wrembel_extending_2019 and @onishi_effects_2016 both examined the perceptual assimilation of L3 sounds to L1 and L2 sounds, it is more difficult to disentangle whether their assimilation choices might be a result of L3 acquisition or previous language influence.
For example, the target like contrast performance by the L3 Japanese speakers, while correlated to L2 performance contrast, does not provide evidence that these speakers began their development with an advantage due to their L2 knowledge. 

The present chapter adds to the scarce work done in L3 perception by recruiting naive bilingual speakers, rather than actual multilingual speakers.
This approach offers valuable information about the absolute starting point in L3 phonological acquisition by investigating whether novel language sounds are assimilated to both L1 and L2 categories when learning begins, rather than later in development.
This distinction is important in the context of L3 models, which debate whether speakers maintain access to both their known languages throughout development. 

## Overview of experiments

The goal of the experiments was to examine how participants categorized and discriminated vowel sounds in a new language.
For this reason, two experiments were created.
The first experiment, designed to measure categorization, was a perceptual assimilation task.
During the perceptual assimilation task, participants heard a single new-language vowel sound and their task was to match the played sound to the most similar vowel sound.
The methodology resembles studies carried out in L2 phonology to test the predictions of the PAM-L2.
Differently from the L2 studies, the present study included both L1 and L2 categories and tested bilinguals rather than functional monolinguals. 

The second experiment was an AX discrimination task.
It examined how all groups discriminated English vowel contrasts when they are in new language words.
Specifically, several seven-step vowel quality continua ranging from /i/ to /\textsci/ and /a/ to  /\ae/–/\textscripta/ was created.
During a trial, participants heard two tokens drawn from the continuum back-to-back and had to determine whether the sounds they heard were the same or different.
This task allowed for the examination of perception in a purely phonetic, rather than phonemic, context, since categorization was not explicitly involved in this task.

# Experiment 1 - L3 Perceptual Assimilation Task 

Experiment one examined the initial state of categorization of the vowels of two unknown languages, French and German, by Spanish-English bilinguals, Spanish monolinguals and English monolinguals. 
Each participant completed a background questionnaire and a perceptual assimilation task.[^p]

[^p]: The results of Experiment 1 of this dissertation have been published in the peer-reviewed journal *Languages* https://doi.org/10.3390/languages7030226

## Participants 

A total of `r nrow(eng_blp) + nrow(span_blp) + length(unique(pct_eng_mono$participant)) + length(unique(pct_span_mono$participant))` participants took part in the present study.
The data of 10 total participants were removed who self-reported being bilingual yet not feeling comfortable speaking or understanding their second language.
The present sample includes L1 Mexican Spanish - L2 English speakers (n = `r nrow(span_blp)`) and L1 American English - L2 Spanish speakers (n = `r nrow(eng_blp)`).
The monolingual participants included `r length(unique(pct_span_mono$participant))` Mexican Spanish monolinguals and `r length(unique(pct_eng_mono$participant))` American English speakers.
All participants were recruited on prolific and were pre-screened according to criteria detailed below.
In addition to filters in place from Prolific.co, the participants were screened further using an adapted version of the Bilingual Language Profile [@birdsong_bilingual_2012].
All participants who answered 'no' to the question "Do you speak a language other than English and Spanish" were permitted to continue the experiment. 

### Bilinguals 

Screening data and experiment-initial questionnaires were used to find bilingual participants who began learning their L2 later in life and reported not having learned a language aside from English and Spanish.
The English L1 group came from all over the 
United States while Spanish L1 group came from Mexico.
Each groups' mean age, L2 use, self-reported oral and perceptive  proficiency are seen in Figure \@ref(fig:aoa).
As can be seen from the figures, the English L1-Spanish L2 group began L2 learning later on average, while they also felt comfortable in their L2 at a later age than the Spanish L1-English L2 group. 
The participants also rated their L2 proficiency. 
They were given a 0-6 Likert-type scale in which they answered the questions "How well do you speak [their L2]?" and "How well do you understand [their L2]?".
"0" corresponded to "not very well at all", where "6" corresponded to "very well" (Figure \@ref(fig:prof)).
On average, the Spanish L1 group rated themselves as more proficient in both speaking and listening than the English L1 group.

## Materials 

### Target phrases/conditions 

The participants heard and categorized a total of 4 vowel conditions per language given seven total carrier words to choose from. 
The four vowel conditions included the /i/, /y/, /o/, and /\textturnv/.
The four sounds were embedded in both a fricative /fVf/ and bilabial /pVp/ or /pVf/ frames and played a total of fice times each. 
Thus, each participant categorized 40 tokens per language (five repetitions x two frames x four vowel conditions), given seven carrier words from which they chose.
The seven word choices included three English carrier word choices intended to represent the phonemes /i/, /\textturnv/, /u/ and /a/ (*feel*, *fun*, *fool* and *thought*).
The remaining 3 choices were Spanish carrier words intended to represent the phonemes /i/, /u/ and /o/ (*fin*, *su*, *son*).
Figure \@ref(fig:vct) shows an example of the trial screen that the participants saw.

The vowel sounds included in both experiments were intended to bring about four distinct cross-linguistic situations. 
First, the L3 phoneme /i/ was included to create a conflict in which both source languages, Spanish and English, have a similar sound /i/. 
The phoneme /i/ was given in the Spanish word *fin* and the English word *feel*.
Next, a centralized vowel, /\textturnv/, was included in an attempt to bias the selection of English. 
This condition was intended to be assimilated to the English choice *fun*.
Third, the phoneme /o/ was included to bias the same Spanish category, where a rounded /o/ does not exist in American English. 
The intended choice in this case was the Spanish word *son*, but the English word *thought* was also provided as an alternative. 
Finally, the phoneme /y/ was added to explore how a sound that is not present in either language will be categorized. 
Given that /y/ is a high-front vowel, it is possible that it could be assimilated to other high vowels, either /i/ as in *feel* or *fin*, or /u/, as provided in *fool* or *su*. 
Additionally, after making each selection, the participants then rated their pick for goodness of fit by clicking a 1-5 continuous Likert scale (\@ref(fig:likert).

```

### Stimuli 

The stimuli were recorded by adult, female L1 speakers of French and German, respectively, and were also collected online via Prolific.
The speakers were given each vowel in a word or non-word in both a fricative and bilabial frame. 
In the event a non-word was provided, a real word containing that vowel sound was included to aid the informant in producing the intended pronunciation of the vowel. 
Once the stimuli were recorded, one of the two tokens provided by the speaker for each vowel was selected and spliced adding the appropriate onset and coda. 
In total, eight stimuli were created per language. 
Figure \@ref(fig:stim) shows the formant values of the included stimuli in German and French in comparison to similar sounds in English and Spanish. 
For the purpose of this Figure, an adult female speaker of Madrid Spanish and an adult female American English speaker provided vowel tokens of the answer choices in the present study by producing the carrier words while being recorded in PRAAT (*son*, *su* and *fin* in Spanish and *fought*, *feel*, *fool*, and *fun* in English).

## Procedure 

First, all participants first completed the adapted Bilingual Language Profile [@birdsong_bilingual_2012] online.
An English and Spanish version of the questionnaire was adapted and given to the participants based on their L1. 
All participants who answered "no" to the question "Besides English and Spanish, do you speak a third language?" were invited to take part in the experimental task.
The perceptual assimilation task was given to participants online. An English and Spanish version of this task was also created, in which all instructions were given in either English or Spanish. 
During the task, all participants heard French first, followed by a brief pause, and then heard German sounds.
The order of the stimuli was counterbalanced and the two tasks were given in a single session with a brief pause between them. 
The experiments were programmed in Psychopy 
[@peirce_psychopy2_2019] and made available online via Pavlovia. 

## Statistical Analysis 

The data were analyzed using a series of Bayesian multilevel multinomial logistic regression models in R @[R-base].
The models were fit using the R package `brms` 
[@burkner2017brms].
A model was run for each of 4 groups: L1 Spanish, L1 English, monolingual English and monolingual Spanish.
In each model, the outcome variable was word choice. 
In the bilingual groups, this consisted of sevel total options (three Spanish words: *fin*, *su*, *son* and four English words: *fun*, *fought*, *feel*, and *fool*).
Additionally, self-rated proficiency was included in the model as a fixed effect.
Thus, the bilingual model estimates the log odds of choosing one of the seven choices, and would sum to 1 when converted to probability. 
The fixed effect predictors of the bilingual models were phoneme (/i/, /\textturnv/, /y/ and /o/) and stimulus language (French or German). 
Random effects included a random intercept for participant to take into account the nested structure of the data. 

The monolingual models analyzed word choice as a function of phoneme and stimulus language, again with a random intercept for participant. 
In this case, language choice was more limited in each group, with the Spanish monolingual group only having 3 options: *fin*, *su*, *son*, while the English group had 4 word choices: *fun*, *fought*, *feel*, and *fool*.
All models included regularizing, weakly informative priors [@gelman_prior_2017], 
which were normally distributed and centered at 0 with a standard deviation of eight for all population-level parameters.
The region of practical equivalence (ROPE) was set to 0.18, as the outcome variable was in log-odds (see @kruschke_rejecting_2018). 
All models were fit with 2000 iterations (1000 warm-up). 
Markov-chain Monte-Carlo sampling was carried out with six chains distributed between six processing cores.

## Results

### English speaking group comparison

Table \ref{tab1} shows the overall percentage of each word choice (out of 4 possible in English), given each of the 4 phonemes in both French and Spanish by the English monolingual group.
The bold numbers are cases in which a word received at least 33 percent of choices.

\label{eq:bayes}

\end{equation}


Figure \@ref(fig:condprobeng) shows the probability of each word choice given a language and phoneme in the monolingual group and compares it to the conditional probability of the same conditions in the bilingual group.
These estimates were derived from the parameter estimates of the Bayesian Multinomial model, in which log odds were converted to probability.
The bilinguals' conditional probability was calculated by dividing the probability from the full model by all categories of that language and shows the probability of a particular selection given that its language has been chosen. 
This calculation allows for the direct comparability between the monolingual and bilingual groups, since the bilinguals had both English and Spanish categories to choose from. 
In other words, the calculation of conditional probability tells us whether bilinguals behave similarly to monolinguals when they choose their L1 to categorize L3 sounds.
The equation \Ref{eq:bayes} illustrates the formula used to calculate the conditional probability of a word choice given that its language has been chosen. 

The triangular shaped points represent the monolingual group and the circular points represent the conditional probability of the bilingual group in the event they chose and English category. 
The color of each point represents each word choice.
In each panel of the figure, it is of interest whether the same color points of different shapes are close to one another, as this would indicate that the bilingual and monolingual groups are assimilating new language sounds to English similarly.

```

Tables \ref{tab2}, \ref{tab3}, \ref{tab4} and \ref{tab5} show the most probable responses of each group given a particular phoneme and language in both the bilingual and monolingual groups.
The 2.5% and 97.5% columns represent the extremes of the 95% Highest Density Interval (HDI), in which 95% of the most probable parameter estimates fell. 
There were some differences between the monolingual and bilingual groups, while other categorizations were rather consistent. 
As inspection of Table \ref{tab2} indicates, the phoneme /i/ was categorized similarly (as *feel*) by monolinguals and bilinguals when they chose an English category, regardless of L3.
On the other hand, Table \ref{tab3} shows that responses to /o/ saw some variation between groups. 
In particular, both *fought* and *fool* were probable responses by the monolingual group in German, while *fun* and *fought* were probable responses in French.
The bilingual group, however, preferred *fool* in German, and *fun* in French. 
Responses to /\textturnv/ also varied. 
In German, the monolingual group preferred the choice *fun*, but *fought* was also a probable response.
In French, the monolingual group preferred *fun*.
The bilingual group preferred *fun* in both German and French. 
Finally, categorizations of /y/ were, like /i/, consistent between the groups and languages.
Both groups assimilated /y/ to *fool* in both French and German.

In sum, the English bilingual and monolingual groups had distinct preferences for some L3 vowels, but not others. 
This result suggests, at least, that learning a second language could have an impact one's categorization of third language sounds in the event participants are only given single-language categories, as has been done in previous studies.

### Monolingual Spanish assimilations 

Unlike the English groups, the Spanish monolingual group and Spanish bilingual group had similar categorization patterns overall when the Spanish bilingual group picked a Spanish category to categorize.
Table \ref{sm_fr} shows the percentage of choices given a phoneme in the Spanish monolingual group in both French and German. 
For all four phonemes, both groups chose the same word the highest percentage of the time. 
In particular, given /i/, both groups chose *fin* the most, while both /o/ and the /\textturnv/ were matched to *son*, and /y/ was assimilated to *su* by both groups in both languages. 
Figure \@ref(fig:condprobsp) visualizes the probabilities generated by the Bayesian Multinomial regression model.
In all cases, the bilingual and monolingual participants appear to categorize French and German sounds similarly.

\end{table}

As can be seen in Tables \ref{el1_fr} and \ref{el1_ger}, the English L1 group, given the L3 French phoneme /i/, chose both their English category /i/ provided in the choice *feel* and their Spanish category /i/ provided in fin *fin*.
German /i/ was categorized similarly. 
For /o/, this group chose *fun* the most often in both cases in French, while the most chosen word in German for /o/ was *fool*. 
/\textturnv/ in both French in German was most often assimilated to the intended category *fun*
Finally, both the L3 French and German phonemes /y/ resulted in choices of *fool* and *su*, the English and Spanish categories for /u/. 

### Spanish L1 group 

Figure \@ref(fig:spandesc) shows the percentage that each answer choice was chosen given a particular phoneme in each language.
Table \ref{sl1_fr} and Table \ref{sl1_ger} similarly report the percentage of each answer choice given a particular phoneme in each language in the Spanish L1 group. 
The Spanish L1 group had a similar preference to the English L1 group in their categorization of /i/, where both English and Spanish categories were chosen. 
However, the Spanish L1 group chose the English category given a German stimulus more often than the Spanish category.
In both French and German, when both /o/ and /\textturnv/ were played, the most chosen answer was *fought*.
Finally, given the phoneme /y/, the Spanish L1 group chose they English *fool* most often in German, and the Spanish *su* most often in French.

### Results of the models 

The output of each model was converted from log-odds to probability using a combination of the `conditional_effects` and `make_conditions` functions in the R package `brms` [@burkner2017brms].
Thus, for each phoneme in each language, the sum of the probability of choosing the categories combined is 1. 
Figure \@ref(fig:imod) shows the probability of each choice in French and German by both groups when /i/ was the phoneme. 
Figure \@ref(fig:omod), shows the same set of probabilities when /o/ is played.
Figures \@ref(fig:schwamod) and \@ref(fig:ymod) represent the probabilities of each response when /\textturnv/ and /y/ are played respectively.

```{r, 'imod', echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Probability of each choice given /i/"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("sections", "figs", "i_full.png"))
```

Figure \@ref(fig:imod) corroborates the trends observed in the descriptive statistics when the participants in both groups were asked to categorize the phoneme /i/ in French and German. 
In particular, for the English L1 group in both French and German and the Spanish L1 group in French, portions of the credible parameter estimates from the posterior distribution overlap with a probability of .5, suggesting that compelling evidence is not present for a preference for the English or Spanish category. 
Differently, the Spanish L1 group did show evidence in German of a preference for the English category *feel*, in which the probability of picking *feel* when the stimulus was German was `r cond_df_prob$estimate__[1] %>% round(digits = 2)` (HDI = `r cond_df_prob$lower__[1] %>% round(digits = 2)` - `r cond_df_prob$upper__[1] %>% round(digits = 2)`).
On the other hand, when phoneme was /i/ in French the probability of choosing *feel* was `r cond_df_prob$estimate__[5] %>% round(digits = 2)` (HDI = `r cond_df_prob$lower__[5] %>% round(digits = 2)` - `r cond_df_prob$upper__[5] %>%  round(digits = 2)`).

After hearing the stimulus /o/, the English L1 group preferred the choice *fun* in French (`r cond_df_prob$estimate__[72] %>% round(digits = 2)` (HDI = `r cond_df_prob$lower__[72] %>% round(digits = 2)` - `r cond_df_prob$upper__[72] %>%  round(digits = 2)`), and *fool* (`r cond_df_prob$estimate__[66] %>% round(digits = 2)` (HDI = `r cond_df_prob$lower__[66] %>% round(digits = 2)` - `r cond_df_prob$upper__[66] %>%  round(digits = 2)`) in German, and the Spanish L1 group preferred *fought* in both languages.
/\textturnv/ was categorized as the choice *fun* in both French (`r cond_df_prob$estimate__[72] %>% round(digits = 2)` [HDI = `r cond_df_prob$lower__[72] %>% round(digits = 2)` - `r cond_df_prob$upper__[72] %>%  round(digits = 2)`] and German (`r cond_df_prob$estimate__[84] %>% round(digits = 2)` [HDI = `r cond_df_prob$lower__[84] %>% round(digits = 2)` - `r cond_df_prob$upper__[84] %>%  round(digits = 2)`]. The Spanish L1 group preferred *fought* in both languages. (French: `r cond_df_prob$estimate__[31] %>% round(digits = 2)` [HDI = `r cond_df_prob$lower__[31] %>% round(digits = 2)` - `r cond_df_prob$upper__[31] %>%  round(digits = 2)`]; German: `r cond_df_prob$estimate__[27] %>% round(digits = 2)` [HDI = `r cond_df_prob$lower__[27] %>% round(digits = 2)` - `r cond_df_prob$upper__[27] %>%  round(digits = 2)`].

The English L1 group assimilated /y/ in both French and German to their English and Spanish /u/ (choices *su* and *fool*), without a clear preference for either.
In particular, the probability of the English L1 group's choice of *su* given the phoneme /y/ and the stimulus language German was `r cond_df_prob$estimate__[103] %>% round(digits = 2)` [HDI = `r cond_df_prob$lower__[103] %>% round(digits = 2)` - `r cond_df_prob$upper__[103] %>%  round(digits = 2)`], while the probability of choosing *fool* was `r cond_df_prob$estimate__[74] %>% round(digits = 2)` [HDI = `r cond_df_prob$lower__[74] %>% round(digits = 2)` - `r cond_df_prob$upper__[74] %>%  round(digits = 2)`].
In French, the probability of choosing *su* given the phoneme /y/ was `r cond_df_prob$estimate__[106] %>% round(digits = 2)` [HDI = `r cond_df_prob$lower__[106] %>% round(digits = 2)` - `r cond_df_prob$upper__[106] %>%  round(digits = 2)`], and the probability of *fool* was `r cond_df_prob$estimate__[78] %>% round(digits = 2)` [HDI = `r cond_df_prob$lower__[78] %>% round(digits = 2)` - `r cond_df_prob$upper__[78] %>%  round(digits = 2)`].

The Spanish L1 group, on the other hand, assimilated French /y/ to the Spanish *su*, and the German /y/ to English *fool*. The probability of the Spanish L1 group's choice of *su* given the phoneme /y/ and the stimulus language French was `r cond_df_prob$estimate__[50] %>% round(digits = 2)` [HDI = `r cond_df_prob$lower__[50] %>% round(digits = 2)` - `r cond_df_prob$upper__[50] %>%  round(digits = 2)`]. 
The probability of the Spanish L1 group's choice of *fool* given the phoneme /y/ and the stimulus language German was `r cond_df_prob$estimate__[18] %>% round(digits = 2)` [HDI = `r cond_df_prob$lower__[18] %>% round(digits = 2)` - `r cond_df_prob$upper__[18] %>%  round(digits = 2)`].

# Experiment 2 - AX Discrimination Task

Experiment two examined the discrimination of two English vowel contrasts using a resynthesized continua.
In particular, the discrimination of the /i/ to /\textsci/ and /\ae/–/\textscripta/ were investigated.
The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether access to English-like vowel contrasts in L3 words in groups in which English was their L1 and when English was the L2. 

## Participants 

A total of `r length(unique(all_df_ax$id))` participants took part in experiment 2.
The data of eight participants was removed, who, despite self-reporting being bilingual, also answered that they were not yet comfortable speaking their second language during the BLP.
The remaining 142 participants made up three total groups:  L1 Mexican Spanish - L2 English speakers (n = `r nrow(span_blp_ax)`), L1 English - L2 Spanish speakers (n = `r nrow(eng_blp_ax)`) and American English monolinguals `r length(unique(eng_mono_ax$id))`.
Many of the L1 Spanish speakers returned for the second experiment, while very few L1 English speakers returned.
In total, eight L1 English-L2 Spanish participants from experiment 1 completed experiment 2, while 44 L1 Spanish-L2 English participants completed both experiment 2. 
Again, all participants were recruited on prolific and were pre-screened according to criteria detailed below.
In addition to filters in place from Prolific.co, the participants were screened further using an adapted version of the Bilingual Language Profile [@birdsong_bilingual_2012].
All participants who answered 'no' to the question "Do you speak a language other than English and Spanish" were permitted to continue the experiment. 

### Bilinguals 

Exactly as in experiment 1, screening data and experiment-initial questionnaires were used to find bilingual participants who began learning their L2 later in life and reported not having learned a language aside from English and Spanish.
The English L1 group came from all over the 
United States while Spanish L1 group came from Mexico.
Each groups mean age, L2 use, self-reported oral and perceptive  proficiency are seen in figure \@ref(fig:aoaax).
As can be seen from the figures, The English L1-Spanish L2 group began L2 learning later on average, while they also felt comfortable in their L2 at a later age than the Spanish L1-English L2 group. 
The participants also rated their L2 proficiency. 
They were given a 0-6 Likert-type scale in which they answered the questions "How well do you speak [their L2]?" and "How well do you understand [their L2]?".
"0" corresponded to "not very well at all", where "6" corresponded to "very well" (Figure \@ref(fig:profax)).
The L1 Spanish group rated themselves higher on average in their L2 spoken proficiency `r mean(span_blp_ax$l2_prof_production) %>% round(digits = 1)` (sd = `r sd(span_blp_ax$l2_prof_production) %>% round(digits = 1)`) than the English group `r mean(eng_blp_ax$l2_prof_production) %>% round(digits = 1)` (sd =`r sd(eng_blp_ax$l2_prof_production) %>% round(digits = 1)`).
The same trend was observed in perception. The L1 Spanish group rated their proficiency in perception as `r mean(span_blp_ax$l2_prof_perception) %>% round(digits = 1)` (sd = `r sd(span_blp_ax$l2_prof_perception) %>% round(digits = 1)`) and English group rated their L2 perception as `r mean(eng_blp_ax$l2_prof_perception) %>% round(digits = 1)` (sd = `r sd(eng_blp_ax$l2_prof_perception) %>% round(digits = 1)`).

## Materials 

### Acoustic continua 

Participants completed two AX discrimination tasks, one in French and one in German. 
During the task, the participants heard two words or psuedowords played back to back and were asked whether they heard a difference between the two words.
These words only differed in a single vowel sound.
This vowel was drawn from a seven step continuum for each vowel contrast. 
Each task contained 149 total trials and was designed to measure the discrimination of two English vowel contrasts: /i/ to /\textsci/ and /\ae/–/\textscripta/ and was embedded into a French or German carrier word.

Eight total 7-step vowel continua were created for this experiment to measure two vowel contrasts in "French" and "German". 
It it important to note that, although French and German do not necessarily make use of these English vowel contrasts, this is not important since these speakers do not yet speak either French or German.
As a result, the use of English-like vowels in what we refer to as "French" or "German", while they may not be authentic, serve the purpose of identifying whether or not these speakers have access to their language-specific discrimination routines in what they believe is a new language, and whether this ability varies as a function of which language they believe that they are hearing.
In each case, a German or French word-pair was produced by a native English speaker by producing the word on both ends of the continuum
by producing, for example, /i/ or /\textsci/ in the given word.
Following these productions, the vowel sounds were extracted and a single onset and offset was saved per word.
Then, using a PRAAT script, the first 3 formants were manipulated to create the continuum, and the vowels were spliced with the saved onsets and offsets, to re-create whole words. 
The carrier words can be seen in Table \ref{carrier_ax}. 
Due to an error, the German carrier word were three /i/ continua and one /a/ continuum.
This error was caused by an erroneous entry in the conditions file of the psychopy experiment used to collect the ends of the continua and was not discovered until after data collection had taken place.
However, this does not appear to have impacted the results, since discrimination was very poor for every contrast.

### Procedure

During the AX discrimination task, participants heard two sounds from a given continuum back to back. 
Their task was to choose whether or not the sounds they heard were the same (by pressing 1) or different (by pressing 0).
Each participant heard a total of 149 tokens per language, which were randomly sampled from the four possible continua per language.
German and French were given in individual sessions with a brief break between them. 
All of the step interval combinations were possible, in which a given step one could also be presented with any other step in the continuum.

## Statistical Analysis

In order to measure sensitivity, d prime (d') [@mcnicol2005primer] was calculated using formula \Ref{eq:dprime}.
D prime is a tool used to measure a subject's ability to detect a signal, and is generally accepted as being more robust as a measure of sensitivity than accuracy alone [@banks1970signal].
The formula uses z(H) and z(F), which are the z-transforms of the hit rate and the false alarm rate.
The hit rate is any case in which a difference between continuum steps is correctly identified.
The false alarm rate refers to choosing that there was difference when there was none.
D prime ranges from 0 (chance) to +/- 4.65 (near-perfect discrimination).

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dprime}
d' = z(H) - z(F)
\end{equation}

In order to determine whether meaningful differences existed between the groups, a Bayesian multilevel model was run.
The outcome variable of the model was d' and the fixed effect predictors were group (L1 English or L1 Spanish), language (French or German), and continuum type (labeled "a" or "i") and self-rated proficiency (continuous 1-7).
A random intercept for participant was included to take into account the nested structure of the data.
Model priors were the default in `brms`, a student's T distribution with 3 degree of freedom. 
All models were fit with 4000 iterations (1000 warm-up). 
Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo sampling was carried out with six chains distributed between eight processing cores.

## Results

Figures \@ref(fig:germ-ax) and \@ref(fig:fren-ax) show d' as a function of language and group.
The boxplots suggest that the English groups slightly outperformed the Spanish group.
\@ref(tab:dprimedesc) reports the mean d' and standard deviation in each group for each token.
Overall, the discrimination of every sound contrast was above chance for the L1 English group, but only around chance for the L1 Spanish group.
Figures \@ref(fig:germ-error-type) and \@ref(fig:fren-error-type) shows the total quantity of each of the four possible outcomes of the a given trial: false alarm, hit, miss, and correct rejection. 
Both figures show that false alarms were slightly more frequent than correct rejections, suggesting that discrimination was close to chance overall.

Specifically, the model estimated that d' for the English group in French was `r report_ax$mean_p[1]` [95% HDI = `r `report_ax$hdi_lo[1]` - `r report_ax$hdi_hi[1]`] and `r report_ax$mean_p[2]` [95% HDI = `r report_ax$hdi_lo[2]` - `r report_ax$hdi_hi[2]`] in German.
On the other hand, the Spanish group was less sensitive to the contrasts in both French `r report_ax$mean_p[3]` [95% HDI = `r report_ax$hdi_lo[3]` - `r report_ax$hdi_hi[3]`] and German `r report_ax$mean_p[4]` [95% HDI = `r report_ax$hdi_lo[4]` - `r report_ax$hdi_hi[4]`].

# Discussion

The present study examined the categorization and discrimination of vowel sounds in German and French languages by Spanish-English bilinguals in both orders of acquisition. 
In several instances, L3 sounds had a similar probability of being assimilated to English or Spanish sound, such as in 3 out of 4 cases with the phoneme /i/. 
The results were mixed in terms of whether the L3 that the participants heard impacted their preference for English or Spanish categories. 
In total, there were three cases in which the L3 did result in the preference for an English or Spanish category out of 16 possible.
In particular, the Spanish L1 group showed a slight preference for the English /i/ (the choice *feel*) when they heard /i/ in German, but not in French. 
Additionally, the Spanish L1 group also categorized the phoneme /y/ differently when they heard it in L3 French than when they heard it in L3 German. 
In particular, the L3 French /y/ was assimilated to Spanish /u/ (*su*) and the L3 German /y/ was assimilated to English /u/ (*fool*). 
Although, in categorization, there was an overall preference for English, the results suggested that bilinguals do have access to both their L1 and L2 during L3 perception and categorization, a finding which single-language access models, such as the TPM and L2SF cannot account for.

These results are best explained by the Linguistic Proximity Model [@westergaard_crosslinguistic_2017;
@westergaard_microvariation_2021], which suggests that L3 learners have access to categories in both their L1 and L2 during L3 acquisition. 
The results of the perceptual assimilation task provided evidence that both groups of bilinguals categorized French and German with both English and Spanish categories.
Only the LPM can account for this result, since other models predict that only one language influences the L3. 
In these cases, one would expect to see L3 vowels categorized using a single language, rather than both of them.
On the other hand, The Typological Primacy Model [@rothman_typological_2010;
@rothman_l3_2011;
@baauw_cognitive_2013;
@rothman_linguistic_2015] suggests that, while bilinguals have access to both their languages at first exposure, this access is lost at some point during what the model refers to as the "initial stages" of L3 acquisition. 
While the present data does not necessarily provide counter-evidence to the TPM, it provides a starting point for future research by providing a picture of the categorization patterns of L3 phonemes in two languages by Spanish-English bilinguals which could be examined in a longitudinal design. If the TPM is correct, a distinct change in categorization would be expected to reflect a bias for a single language's category. 
The present study provides a basis of comparison, and evidence that bilinguals do have access to both the L1 and L2 at first exposure. 
However, in six out of eight cases, global typological similarity (English and German vs. French and Spanish), did not result in any obvious bias in categorization. 

It is unclear why the Spanish L1 group seemed to be sensitive to which L3 they heard, where the English L1 group was not.
It is worth noting that there are differences between the groups in self-rated proficiency and age of onset and acquisition; the Spanish L1 group rated themselves as more proficient on average in spoken and perceptual abilities and had an earlier age of onset and acquisition on average. 
L3 models have suggested that differences in L2 proficiency impact its level of influence on the L3. 
For example, the TPM has stated that the L2 must be sufficiently proficient to be a source of influence. 
In this view, a beginning learner of a second languages is not thought to be able to transfer their L2 representations to their L3 initial state and, in many of the TPM studies to date, this has been taken to mean "advanced proficiency".
Though the present study was not interested in the effect of L2 proficiency on L3 categorizations, it is worth noting that the group differences in proficiency might have impacted the results, although it is difficult to say exactly how, since the cutoff for "advanced" proficiency is subjective and arbitrary.
This notion of the impact of L2 proficiency on CLI could be further investigated, in which the more traditional categorical grouping of proficiency (e.g., novice, intermediate, advanced) could also be examined in a continuous fashion and corroborated across measures. 
In other words, it's unclear for the purpose of the present study, and likely with many proficiency measures, where the TPM's cutoff for "advanced" should be. 

In discrimination, the L1 English group outperformed the L1 Spanish group, although discrimination was not excellent by either group. 
It is possible that the nature of online data collection was associated with this poor performance across groups.
For instance, it may be that inconsistent speaker quality, varied speaker attention levels and inconsistent use of headphones all contributed to poor performance. 
Future experiments for AX discrimination should take place in a lab setting in which these variables can be properly controlled.
Despite these potential limitations, the result that the L1 English speakers outperformed the L1 Spanish speakers can still be inform L3 perception.
The contrasts in the AX discrimination task were English contrasts and, although both groups speak English (as a first or second language), it appears that native language discrimination may play a role in L3 processing.
This result is surprising based on the predictions of current L3 models, since none of them posit a privileged status for the native language.
To the author's knowledge, only the work by @hermas2010language has suggested that a speaker's L1 contrains L3 development, and that this view has not been formally modeled.

The present study had additional limitations. 
Firstly, as briefly mentioned in reference to the AX discrimination task, online studies offers unique challenges and limitations.
One potential issue is the lack of the ability to  control the participant's environment outside of the instructions and experiment itself. 
As a result, language mode effects [@grosjean1998transfer; @casillas_perceptual_2018] cannot be completely ruled out. 
Additionally, headphone quality, speaker quality, background noise and volume level are all variables within the participant's control that could not be reasonably controlled for in the context of online data collection. 
Second, self-reported proficiency, while convenient and fast, is a subjective measure of language ability that would likely be improved by a more objective proficiency measure such as the LexTALE [@lemhofer_introducing_2012].
Future research could aim to test categorization and discrimination at at L3 first exposure in a better controlled lab setting.

# Conclusion

This chapter presented two experiments that analyzed the categorization and discrimination of novel language sounds by bilinguals.
In particular, this chapter was concerned with how Spanish-English bilinguals categorized French and German vowels given both of their language categories, and whether discrimination of English-like vowels would be successful in the new languages.
Primarily, the purpose of these experiments was to determine whether bilinguals would show bias toward either their L1 or L2 when they perceive new language vowels based on typology or language status.
The experiments showed that the categorization of both French and German vowels were matched to the most appropriate English or Spanish category, and there was not evidence of typological or language status effects blocking access to a given language. 
In discrimination, the L1 English speakers better discriminated both English-like vowel contrasts in L3 stimuli than the L1 Spanish speakers.
