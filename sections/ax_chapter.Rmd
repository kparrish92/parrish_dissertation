Experiment two examined the discrimination of several English vowel contrasts using a resynthesized continua.
The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether access to English-like vowel contrasts in L3 words in groups in which English was their L1 and when English was the L2. 

## Participants 

A total of `r length(unique(all_df_ax$id))` participants took part in experiment 2.
The data of 8 participants was removed, who, despite self-reporting being bilingual, also answered that they were not yet comfortable speaking their second language during the BLP.
The remaining 142 participants made up three total groups:  L1 Mexican Spanish - L2 English speakers (n = `r nrow(span_blp_ax)`), L1 English - L2 Spanish speakers (n = `r nrow(eng_blp_ax)`) and American English monolinguals `r length(unique(eng_mono_ax$id))`.
Many of the L1 Spanish speakers returned for the second experiment, while very few L1 English speakers returned.
In total, 8 L1 English-L2 Spanish participants from experiment 1 completed experiment 2, while 44 L1 Spanish-L2 English participants completed both experiment 2. 
Again, All participants were recruited on prolific and were pre-screened according to criteria detailed below.
In addition to filters in place from Prolific.co, the participants were screened further using an adapted version of the Bilingual Language Profile [@birdsong_bilingual_2012].
All participants who answered 'no' to the question "Do you speak a language other than English and Spanish" were permitted to continue the experiment. 

### Bilinguals 

Exactly as in experiment 1, screening data and experiment-initial questionnaires were used to find bilingual participants who began learning their L2 later in life and reported not having learned a language aside from English and Spanish.
The English L1 group came from all over the 
United States while Spanish L1 group came from Mexico.
Each groups mean age, L2 use, self-reported oral and perceptive  proficiency are seen in figure \@ref(fig:aoaax).
As can be seen from the figures, The English L1-Spanish L2 group began L2 learning later on average, while they also felt comfortable in their L2 at a later age than the Spanish L1-English L2 group. 
The participants also rated their L2 proficiency. 
They were given a 0-6 Likert-type scale in which they answered the questions "How well do you speak [their L2]?" and "How well do you understand [their L2]?".
"0" corresponded to "not very well at all", where "6" corresponded to "very well" (Figure \@ref(fig:profax)).
The L1 Spanish group rated themselves higher on average in their L2 spoken proficiency `r mean(span_blp_ax$l2_prof_production) %>% round(digits = 1)` (sd = `r sd(span_blp_ax$l2_prof_production) %>% round(digits = 1)`) than the English group `r mean(eng_blp_ax$l2_prof_production) %>% round(digits = 1)` (sd =`r sd(eng_blp_ax$l2_prof_production) %>% round(digits = 1)`).
The same trend was observed in perception. The L1 Spanish group rated their proficiency in perception as `r mean(span_blp_ax$l2_prof_perception) %>% round(digits = 1)` (sd = `r sd(span_blp_ax$l2_prof_perception) %>% round(digits = 1)`) and English group rated their L2 perception as `r mean(eng_blp_ax$l2_prof_perception) %>% round(digits = 1)` (sd = `r sd(eng_blp_ax$l2_prof_perception) %>% round(digits = 1)`).

## Materials

Participants completed two AX discrimination tasks, one in French and one in German. 
During the task, the participants heard two words or psuedowords played back to back and were asked whether they heard a difference between the two words.
These words only differed in a single vowel sound.
This vowel drawn from a seven step continuum for each vowel contrast. 
Each task contained 149 total trials and was designed to measure the discrimination of two English vowel contrasts: /i-I/ and /a-ae/ and was embedded into a French or German carrier word.

### Target phrases/conditions 

### Stimuli 

The original stimuli were recorded by a multilingual speakers of French, German and English. 
In both French and German, both ends of the continuum (e.g., )
